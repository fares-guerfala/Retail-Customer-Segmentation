## Introduction
In this project, we analyze customer data from a retail company to gain insights into customer behavior. By segmenting customers into distinct groups, we aim to assist the company in making data-driven decisions related to marketing campaigns, target audiences, and product offerings.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you will need Python installed on your machine. You can follow the steps provided in the code to load and analyze the dataset.

## Usage
You can use this project to:
- Analyze customer behavior and preferences.
- Segment customers into distinct groups.
- Identify key characteristics of each customer segment.
- Make informed decisions regarding marketing strategies and product offerings.

## Data & Features
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle. It contains information on 2240 customers with 29 attributes each, including personal information, purchase history, and response to marketing campaigns. <br>
Here are some of the key features used in this analysis:
- Customer's age, education level, and marital status.
- Household income and number of children.
- Purchase history for various product categories.
- Response to marketing campaigns and purchases made with discounts.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project includes exploratory data analysis to visualize the dataset and understand customer characteristics and behavior. EDA involves creating various plots and visualizations to provide insights into the data.

## Dimensionality Reduction
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variance. This step helps in simplifying the dataset for clustering.

## K-Means Clustering
The K-Means clustering algorithm is used to group customers into clusters based on their features. Three distinct clusters are identified, each representing different customer profiles.

## Interpretation of Results
- Cluster 1: High-income customers who spend more and are less sensitive to discounts.
- Cluster 2: Lower-income customers who spend less and are slightly younger.
- Cluster 3: Medium-income customers with children, highly responsive to discounts, and prefer non-essential items.

The interpretation of results provides actionable insights for targeting specific customer groups with marketing campaigns and product offerings.
